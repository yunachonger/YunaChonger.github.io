  <p> My name is Yuna Chong.
  <p> I currently attend William Lyon Mackenzie C.I and am enrolled in the MaCS program. This program provides a more enriched education of math and computer science.
  <p> Some of my hobbies includes music, art, baking, and swimming. Music is a huge part of my life, as I play the cello, and have been for the past 9 years. I also used
  <br>to sing, and I enjoy listening to music as well.
  <p> I am part of many extracurriculars inside and outside of school. In Mackenzie, I am a general member for MSC and HOSA. I am also the budgeting and supplies
  <br>executive for the visual arts council, and the front of house for the central arts council. Outside of school, I try to involve myself as much as I can. I am an
  <br>assistant teacher for math classes, and was an assistant teacher for a York University summer coding camp. Additionally, I tutor ESL students online, volunteer at 
  <br>Baycrest, and volunteer at the library to teach young students how to read. I am a youth council member for an organization called Ontario Nature, where I have helped
  <br>to organize and lead retreats, workshops and projects. I am also part of a youth orchestra, where I play the cello. Furthermore, I am an assistant instructer for swimming 
  <br>classes.
  <p> Aside from my extracurriculars, my future goals surround computer science. I love math and coding, and am hoping that my future will entail these subjects.
  <br>This portfolio contains the topics I have learned over the course of AP ICS and the projects I have worked on over the years.
